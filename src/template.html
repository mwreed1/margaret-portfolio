                In this day and age, data is more important than ever. However,
                good data is not very accessible to most ordinary folks, so I am
                a firm believer of well-designed, interactive data
                visualizations, that allow all people the ability to make their
                own data driven decisions.

                Born and raised in Chapel Hill, NC, I have always enjoyed living
                by a university with all of the academics and opportunities it
                affords. Now that I attend Duke university I get to fully take
                advantage of the university perks. I enjoy doing research,
                teaching, and working on data projects that I am excited by.

                In the 2019-20 academic year, I worked with a research group
                that analyzed longterm, whole ecosystem data from the ELA
                (Experimental Lakes Area) as to best visualize and communicate
                the crucial environmental findings. Over the summer I interned
                at Amazon as a software development engineering intern. This
                fall, I volunteered on a political campaign as a data analyst.
                Two other undergraduate students and I ran analyses for and
                strategized with the campaign team in order to best support
                them. Over the winter I volunteered on the communications and
                marketing working group with Bluebonnet Data, the organization
                I volunteered with in the fall. This semester I will be a
                teaching assistant for two undergraduate classes.

                  I have experience with both software development and data
                science. I have also taken several classes pertaining to both,
                including classes on algorithms, machine learning, data science,
                bayesian statistics, linear algebra and more. I have
                participated in several hackathons and datathons, including

                  Sweden (pictured). I love music and have been playing the
                  cello for over 10 years. I have kept it up in college by
                  playing in the pit orchestra for musicals with the student-led
